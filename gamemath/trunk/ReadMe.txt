gamemath contains a collection of mathematical functions useful for games and other applications. Included modules:

FixedPoint: Fractional numbers using integer representation. Useful for cross-platform numeric consistency and uniform precision density.

Interpolation: Floating point values animated over arbitrary curve types. Intended for graphical effects; not recommended for precise calculations or performance critical code.

Matrix: Arbitrary 4x4 transformations. For information on matrices: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/matrix.html

Quaternion: 3D orientations. For information on quaternions: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/quaternion.html

Vector: Spatial positions or directions. All permutations of 2/3/4 component and int/float/double/fixed are included, with the relevant functions autogenerated for each. For information on vectors: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/vector.html
