gamemath contains a collection of mathematical functions useful for games and other applications. Included modules:

Barycentric: Coordinate conversions from cartesian to barycentric space and back.

BezierCurve: Some simple functions for working with floating point bezier curves. Intended for graphical effects; not recommended for precise calculations or performance critical code.

FixedPoint: Fractional numbers using integer representation. Useful for cross-platform numeric consistency and uniform precision density.

Interpolation: Floating point values animated over arbitrary curve functions. Intended for graphical effects; not recommended for precise calculations or performance critical code.

Matrix: Arbitrary 4x4 transformations. For information on matrices: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/matrix.html

MouseCoordinateTransforms: Specialty functions for converting between different representations of mouse positions. Functions take inputs of mouse coordinates as specified to Shell mouse event callbacks, and output coordinates for commonly used orthographic OpenGL projections.

ParameterSpline: Arbitrary curve functions controlled by a series of bezier curves. Can be used with Interpolation, or on their own.

Quaternion: 3D orientations. For information on quaternions: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/quaternion.html

Rect/Box: 2D or 3D axis aligned boundaries. All permutations of int/float/double/fixed are included, with the relevant functions autogenerated for each.

Vector: Spatial positions or directions. All permutations of 2/3/4 component and int/float/double/fixed are included, with the relevant functions autogenerated for each. For information on vectors: http://ludobloom.com/tutorials/vector.html
