2.3.0 (2015-10-03)
 * Added Rect4* and Box6* for 2D and 3D boundaries, with numeric types matching those provided by Vector*
 * Added Vector*_invert() and Vector*_inverted()
 * Fixed multiplications in Vector*x_reflect() and Vector*x_magnitude() giving wildly incorrect results
 * Fixed a bug that caused xsqrt to be nonterminating for some inputs
 * xmul and xdiv now return FIXED_16_16_INF or FIXED_16_16_NINF if the result overflows a 32-bit type
 * xmul and xdiv now return FIXED_16_16_INF, FIXED_16_16_NINF, or FIXED_16_16_NAN as appropriate if one of both of their inputs is inf or nan
 * Added VectorConversions.h and RectBoxConversions.h with convenience macros for converting between structure data types and (for vectors) axis counts
 * Added MouseCoordinateTransforms

2.2.0 (2014-11-02)
 * Renamed project from 3dmath to gamemath to more accurately fit its purpose
 * Added Interpolation module
 * Added xtof, ftox, xtod, and dtox macros (aliases of fixed16_16ToFloat, floatToFixed16_16, fixed16_16ToDouble, and doubleToFixed16_16, respectively)

2.1.1 (2014-06-29)
 * Added support for modern Xcode/iOS SDK versions
 * Renamed Matrix_rotate() "angle" parameter to "radians" for clarity

2.1.0 (2014-01-22)
 * Added Vector*_project()
 * Added Vector*_distance() and Vector*_distanceSquared() (2.0.0 had prototypes for them but implementations were missing)
 * Added Vector2x_rotate()
 * Vector*_reflect() is now implemented correctly to return reflection rather than negated reflection
 * Removed Vector_legacy.h
 * Fixed-point multiply and divide now round the result instead of truncating

2.0.0 (2014-01-10)
 * Added FixedPoint
 * Vector2, Vector3, and Vector4 now come in f (float), d (double), i (int), and x (16.16 fixed-point) variants
 * Legacy code can #include "3dmath/Vector_legacy.h" for macros that make existing references to Vector2, Vector3, and Vector4 behave as Vector2f, Vector3f, and Vector4f, respectively
 * Replaced Vector*_init() functions with VECTOR*(x, y[, z[, w]]) macros (type suffix is lower case)
 * Replaced Quaternion_init() function with QUATERNION(x, y, z, w) macro
 * Replaced Matrix_init() function with MATRIX(...) macro
 * Removed unfinished and unused Frustum

1.4.0 (2013-07-08)
 * Vector*_normalize() now returns a success boolean. Zero-magnitude vectors now return false and remain unaltered.
 * Added Matrix_interpolate() and Matrix_interpolated()
 * Added Vector*_scaleTo() and Vector*_scaledTo()
 * Added Vector2 and Vector4 constants: VECTOR2_LEFT, VECTOR2_RIGHT, VECTOR2_DOWN, VECTOR2_UP, VECTOR4_LEFT, VECTOR4_RIGHT, VECTOR4_DOWN, VECTOR4_UP, VECTOR4_BACK, VECTOR4_FRONT, VECTOR4_KATA, and VECTOR4_ANA
 * Added 64-bit Windows and Linux support

1.3.0 (2012-04-10)
 * Replaced functions that return prefabricated vectors, matrices, and quaternions (Vector2_zero(), Vector3_up(), Quaternion_identity(), Matrix_identity(), etc.) with compile-time constants

1.2.0 (2011-10-13)
 * Added Vector2_rotate() function
 * Changed some parameter names for greater clarity (particularly to distinguish between degrees and radians)

1.1.0 (2010-10-09)
 * Added Vector*_reflect() functions
 * Removed Quaternion_fromVector() and Quaternion_toVector()
 * More efficient implementations of Quaternion_multiply() and Quaternion_multiplyVector*()
 * Synced with latest template_stemlib

1.0.0 (2010-06-04)
 * Refreshed Makefile from template_stemlib Stable_2010-06-02
 * Minor code formatting/naming tweaks

0.2.0 (2010-04-25)
 * Implemented Matrix_ortho() and Matrix_applyOrtho()
 * Refreshed Makefile and svn:externals from template_stemlib Stable_2010-04-23

0.1.0 (2010-04-07)
 * Refreshed Makefile and other project files from template_stemlib Stable_2010-04-06
