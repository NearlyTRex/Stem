// - If width is GLTEXTUREATLAS_SIZE_AUTO, the returned size will have the specified height and an aspect-correct width calculated by the entry size.
// - If height is GLTEXTUREATLAS_SIZE_AUTO, the returned size will have the specified width and an aspect-correct height calculated by the entry size.
// - If both width and height are GLTEXTUREATLAS_SIZE_AUTO, the returned size is in pixels.
// - If neither width nor height is GLTEXTUREATLAS_SIZE_AUTO, the specified values are returned. This is not useful behavior, so specify GLTEXTUREATLAS_SIZE_AUTO for one or both of them when you call this function.

Vector2f GLTextureAtlas_getEntryDimensions(GLTextureAtlas * self, const char * key, float width, float height);

// Returns vertex data suitable for drawing a sprite with GL_TRIANGLES. Parameters:
// - key: Name of atlas entry to be drawn.
// - offset: Drawing origin. These values are added to all returned vertex positions.
// - relativeOrigin: Sprite's origin point in normalized coordinates. A value of {0, 0} will place the lower left vertex at the position specified by offset; {0.5, 0.5} will place the center at offset; {1, 1} will place the upper right corner at offset, and so on.
// - size: Dimensions of the sprite. GLTextureAtlas_getEntryDimensions() returns values appropriate for this parameter.
// - indexType: Data type of outIndexes. Must be one of GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.
// - baseIndex: Numeric offset to be applied to all returned indexes. If multiple objects are being drawn with the same vertex/index array, pass the number of vertices that have been written prior to calling this function.
// - outVertices: If not NULL, vertex data will be written to this pointer.
// - outIndexes: If not NULL, vertex index data of the type specified by indexType will be written to this pointer.
// - ioVertexCount: Returns the number of vertices written to outVertices, or if outVertices is NULL, the amount of space required to write to it. If this value is nonzero when called, the number of vertices written is added to it.
// - ioIndexCount: Returns the number of indexes written to outIndexes, or if outIndexes is NULL, the amount of space required to write to it. If this value is nonzero when called, the number of indexes written is added to it.
// 
// Typical usage: Call this function once with outVertices and outIndexes set to NULL in order to determine how much space
// is needed, by using ioVertexCount and ioIndexCount. Allocate the necessary space with glBufferData, use glMapBuffer to
// get a pointer to it, and call this function again to write the data to it.
