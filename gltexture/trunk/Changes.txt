1.2.1 (2015-07-07)
 * Removed the baseIndex parameter from GLTextureAtlas_getVertices() and GLTextureAtlas_getVerticesWithColor(). It's now inferred from ioVertexCount.

1.2.0 (2014-11-20)
 * Removed GLTextureAtlas_getIndexes, and merged its functionality with GLTextureAtlas_getVertices
 * GLTextureAtlas_getVertices now uses Vector2f instead of raw floats for offsetX/offsetY and relativeOriginX/relativeOriginY
 * Added GLTextureAtlas_getVerticesWithColor and GLTextureAtlas_getEntryDimensions
 * Added an option to set a GLTexture pointer in GLTextureAtlas, taking ownership if desired (see GLTextureAtlas_setTexture and the 'texture' struct field)
 * Removed function pointers to GLTexture and GLTextureAtlas methods from their structs in preparation for stemobject 4.0.0. Call the GLTexture_*()/GLTextureAtlas_*() methods directly instead.
 * GLTexture objects that have been initialized but have not had setImage called on them will have pixelWidth and pixelHeight set to 0 instead of an uninitialized value.

1.1.0 (2014-06-29)
 * Added GLTextureAtlas
 * Added support for modern Xcode/iOS SDK versions

1.0.4 (2013-12-25)
