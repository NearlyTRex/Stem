2.1.0 (2018-09-01)
 * Removed GLBitmapFont_getStringVerticesWithColor(). GLBitmapFont_getStringVertices() now takes struct vertex_p2f_t2f_c4f. struct vertex_p2f_t2f is no longer supported.
 * Removed baseIndex parameter from GLBitmapFont_getStringVertices(). It's now inferred from ioVertexCount.
 * Removed indexType parameter from GLBitmapFont_getStringVertices(). GL_UNSIGNED_INT is now the only valid index type.
 * Added pixelSnapping parameter to GLBitmapFont_getStringVertices() for less blurry pixel-exact text rendering.
 * Added clipBounds parameter to GLBitmapFont_getStringVertices() to allow drawing a partial region of a string.
 * Added TextFlow to assist with handling multiline and word wrapped text.
 * Renamed GLBitmapFont_indexAtWidth() to GLBitmapFont_indexAtPositionX(). It also now takes a few more arguments.
 * Fixed crash when deserializing malformed GLBitmapFont data.
 * Updated to use TextureAtlas from glgraphics instead of GLTextureAtlas from gltexture.

2.0.0 (2014-11-20)
 * GLBitmapFont's texture coordinate storage has been superseded by GLTextureAtlas. Instead of texture coordinates, GLBitmapFont now stores a key for atlas lookup.
 * References to texture have been renamed/repurposed to refer to a texture atlas instead.
 * drawString has been replaced by getStringVertices/getStringVerticesWithColor.
 * GLFont was unnecessary and no longer exists. GLBitmapFont now inherits directly from StemObject.
 * convertfontunits is obsolete and has been removed.
 * In preparation for stemobject 4.0.0, instance methods no longer exist as struct fields. Instead of calling instance->method(instance, ...), call GLBitmapFont_method(instance, ...).
 * GLBitmapFont functions that take a length parameter can now accept GLBITMAPFONT_USE_STRLEN instead of an explicit length
