2.0.0 (2014-11-08)
 * GLBitmapFont's texture coordinate storage has been superseded by GLTextureAtlas. Instead of texture coordinates, GLBitmapFont now stores a key for atlas lookup.
 * References to texture have been renamed/repurposed to refer to a texture atlas instead.
 * GLFont no longer exists. GLBitmapFont retains the measureString and indexAtWidth functions, but drawString has been replaced by getStringIndexes and getStringVertices/getStringVerticesWithColor.
 * convertfontunits is obsolete and has been removed.
 * In preparation for stemobject 4.0.0, instance methods no longer exist as struct fields. Instead of calling instance->method(instance, ...), call GLBitmapFont_method(instance, ...).
