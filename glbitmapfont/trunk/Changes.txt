2.0.1 (2015-02-19)
 * Fixed crash when deserializing malformed GLBitmapFont data

2.0.0 (2014-11-20)
 * GLBitmapFont's texture coordinate storage has been superseded by GLTextureAtlas. Instead of texture coordinates, GLBitmapFont now stores a key for atlas lookup.
 * References to texture have been renamed/repurposed to refer to a texture atlas instead.
 * drawString has been replaced by getStringVertices/getStringVerticesWithColor.
 * GLFont was unnecessary and no longer exists. GLBitmapFont now inherits directly from StemObject.
 * convertfontunits is obsolete and has been removed.
 * In preparation for stemobject 4.0.0, instance methods no longer exist as struct fields. Instead of calling instance->method(instance, ...), call GLBitmapFont_method(instance, ...).
 * GLBitmapFont functions that take a length parameter can now accept GLBITMAPFONT_USE_STRLEN instead of an explicit length
