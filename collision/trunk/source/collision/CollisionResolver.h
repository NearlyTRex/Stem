// ADDITIONAL MODULE NEEDED: CollisionPairManager
// - Responsible for taking list of objects and returning a list of pairs that need to be evaluated for collision
// - With some smarts, can be made much more efficient:
//  - Don't test static objects against static objects
//  - Don't retest unchanged pairs on subsequent iterations
// - Could take over cycleDetectionBuffer
// - Space partitioning would be a separate subsystem still needed after this
