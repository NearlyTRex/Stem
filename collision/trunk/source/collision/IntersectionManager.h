// - Return true and write to outTime, outNormal, outObject1Vector, outObject2Vector, and outCollisionArea if an intersection is detected
// - Return false and do not modify out parameters if no intersection is detected
// - Any of outTime, outNormal, outObject1Vector, outObject2Vector, and outCollisionArea may be NULL; check before writing to them
// - Values written to outTime MUST be in the range of [0x00000, 0x10000]; if computed time is outside this range, return false instead
// - Values written to outNormal must be normalized, and should point away from object1's trajectory
// - Values written to outNormal for 2D shapes must have the z component set to 0x00000
