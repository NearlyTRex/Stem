// Callback to be invoked when a collision has been detected and needs to be resolved. This callback is responsible for
// updating the CollisionObject's trajectory or other parameters in some way to resolve the specified collision and ensure
// it would not be detected again immediately. For example, if two CollisionCircles collide, the CollisionCallback on both
// could set their position field to the value of their lastPosition field, which would stop the motion of both and prevent
// further collisions between them.
// 
// timesliceSize specifies the scale of the timeslice that was being evaluated when this collision was detected. This may
// include some amount of time before and/or after the collision occurred. CollisionRecord's time, object1Vector, and
// object2Vector fields are relative to timeslice size, so you may want to divide by this value if you need to rescale any
// of those values to whole-frame time.
// 
// subframeTime specifies the temporal position within the whole frame being evaluated at which the collision occurs. This
// is in contrast to CollisionRecord's time field, which is relative to the size of the timeslice, not the entire frame.
// At the time a CollisionCallback is called, its CollisionObject will have been interpolated to this position, so the
// remaining trajectory is relative to the remaining time in the frame.
