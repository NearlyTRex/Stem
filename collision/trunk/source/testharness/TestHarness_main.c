	//  - Overhead controls
	//  - Bouncing balls
	//  - Single-frame and sub-frame simulation (set up lastPosition and position for each object, and step through intersection tests and resolution in detail)
	// - Place arbitrary shapes into a simulation and allow them to intercollide
	// - Stress test (control number/speed of collisiding objects with performance metrics)
