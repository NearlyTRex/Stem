1.0.1 (DATE)
 * Added LONG_LONG_FORMAT, ULONG_LONG_FORMAT, and XLONG_LONG_FORMAT to printfFormats.h, since long long is semantically different from int64_t on 64-bit Linux

 * Changed project structure to standard stem library rather than naked source files
 * SUITE_FILE_LIST macro obsoleted, replaced by link-time UnitTest_suiteNameList symbol
