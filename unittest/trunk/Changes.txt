1.1.0 (DATE)
 * TestSerializationContext and TestDeserializationContext have been moved from unittest to serialization to resolve circular dependency
 * Added LONG_LONG_FORMAT, ULONG_LONG_FORMAT, and XLONG_LONG_FORMAT to printfFormats.h, since long long is semantically different from int64_t on 64-bit Linux

1.0.0 (2013-12-25)
 * Changed project structure to standard stem library rather than naked source files
 * SUITE_FILE_LIST macro obsoleted, replaced by link-time UnitTest_suiteNameList symbol
 * Fixed printf format specifiers for 64-bit integers on Linux
 * unittest headers now reside in unittest/, rather than unittest/framework/
