2.1.1 (2017-10-18)
 * Fixed modifier keys sticking when holding one while deactivating the application and having released it before reactivating (such as by alt-tabbing, then clicking on the window). Modifier key state is now updated on all key downs and ups.
 * Fixed a bug that caused the Shell_mouseMovedFunc callback to be called when entering full screen with mouse delta mode enabled
 * Removed glgraphics dependency. Glew is now initialized directly by wglshell, and GLGraphics_init() is no longer called.

2.1.0 (2014-12-13)
 * Updated for shell 2.1.0 (adds Shell_setVSync (which replaces WGLShell_setVSync), Shell_openFileDialog, Shell_saveFileDialog, Shell_systemBeep, Shell_getSafeWindowRect, Shell_confirmQuitFunc, and isRepeat argument to Shell_keyDownFunc callback)
 * Shell now responds to Alt-F4 and Ctrl-F4
 * Fixed a bug that caused the Shell_resizeFunc callback not to be called as frequently as it should have been during window resizing
 * System beeps will no longer occur on keypresses with alt held
 * Fixed a bug that caused GLGraphics to be initialized with GL_API_VERSION_DESKTOP_1 when it should have been GL_API_VERSION_DESKTOP_2 and vice versa
 * wglshell's GL context is now destroyed at exit, which prevents crash-on-exit after recording game footage with OBS

2.0.0 (2014-10-21)
 * Updated for shell 2.0.0 (adds multiple display support, scroll wheel events, registered callbacks for input events)

1.1.0 (2014-01-10)
 * Updated for shell 1.2.0 (adds Shell_openURL)
 * Added multisampling and accumulation buffer options to WGLShellConfiguration
 * Modifier keys now produce Target_keyDown() and Target_keyUp() events
 * Eliminated redundant Target_resized() events
