2.0.0 (2014-11-18)
 * Renamed project from statecontroller to screenmanager
 * Renamed StateContoller class to ScreenManager, and State class to Screen
 * ScreenManager now prints warnings to stderr in debug builds for attempted invalid operations (calling setScreen or addTransition with a screen that wasn't added with addScreen, or calling transition with a transition string that wasn't registered for the current screen)
 * Removed Screen_draw function. The recommended approach to drawing the active screen is to dispatch a draw event through ScreenManager's EventDispatcher, which each Screen registers to receive in its activate() method.
 * Removed function pointers to ScreenManager methods from its struct in preparation for stemobject 4.0.0. Call the ScreenManager_*() methods directly instead.
