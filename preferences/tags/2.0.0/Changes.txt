2.0.0 (2014-12-01)
 * preferences now uses DataValue for everything, allowing hierarchical storage. API simplified accordingly.
 * Preferences_add(Integer|Float|String|Boolean|Data) functions have been removed. Values no longer need to be registered before being set.
 * Preferences_loadDefaultValue and Preferences_loadDefaultValues functions have been removed. Preferences no longer tracks a set of default values.
