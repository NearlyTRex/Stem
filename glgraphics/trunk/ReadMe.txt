TODO: Update everything below, with descriptions for each class
GLGraphics provides some miscellaneous general-purpose OpenGL utility code. Included modules:

	* GLGraphics defines GLGraphics_init, which is to be called at startup (by the shell, if applicable) to initialize glew (if applicable) and define the OpenGL API version, which can later be retrieved with GLGraphics_getOpenGLAPIVersion.

	* GLIncludes.h is a convenience header that #includes the appropriate OpenGL headers for the target platform.

	* GLSLShader provides simplified vertex and fragment shader setup.

	* GLUtilities provides OpenGL utility functions for translating between string representations and GLenum representations of OpenGL constants.

Shape keys/morph targets are pretty tricky. Ideas:
- Organize vertices into groups which own morph sets, up to some limit in the vertex shader. Different glDrawElements calls for each group.
* Calculate all morphs in software, and resubmit vertex data every frame for animations that have morphs (only if dirty?).
- Limit entire mesh to some number of morphs, and encode all morph offsets into static vertex data with uniforms for weights.
- Encode vertex data as normal, but calculate offsets for everything at once in software and pass those in some other way. Sampler?
 - This is essentially no better than resubmitting vertex data every frame, since it contains a full list of positions/offsets anyway

Constraints and control objects are Blender-only. Exported animations can be flattened.

MATERIAL STUFF
- Color map (two layers?)
- Specular map
- Normal map
- Displacement map
- Occlusion map
- Subsurface scattering (research needed)
- PBR
 - Metalness
 - Roughness
 - AO


TODO:
- Fresnel effect
- No current mechanism for anything other than built-in shaders. Is this a problem?
- Animation controller object with graph logic? Also event dispatching
- IK (https://www.webcitation.org/60uCFHqC2?url=http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_ik2.htm)
- Advanced lighting (research needed)
 - Idea: Keep multiple fragment shaders compiled and ready; on CPU, compute the number of influencing lights for each object, and select shader with appropriate number of lights in it to draw that object, up to a reasonable maximum
 - Multipass with deferred lighting
- Depth sorting
- VR

LOWER PRIORITY:
- Camera work:
 - Camera interpolation (controller object interpolates between different camera objects)
 - Other cameras: First person, follow behind/ahead
- Morphing? (maybe better to do without)
- Possible normal map optimization: Do all lighting calculations in tangent space, so fragment shader doesn't have to do a matrix multiplication per fragment
- Calculate normal matrix in renderer instead of vertex shader
- Culling
- Fog
- Shadows
- SSAO
- Cloth simulation
- Instancing
- Color deficiency shaders


ANIMATION STUFF
- Some animations need to be smarter than just a time value. Quadruped locomotion gives four ground positions. Looking takes a target vector. Blinking, breathing, etc. can be simple, but needs to be blended, and follow different intervals sometimes.
