TODO: Update everything below, with descriptions for each class
GLGraphics provides some miscellaneous general-purpose OpenGL utility code. Included modules:

	* GLGraphics defines GLGraphics_init, which is to be called at startup (by the shell, if applicable) to initialize glew (if applicable) and define the OpenGL API version, which can later be retrieved with GLGraphics_getOpenGLAPIVersion.

	* GLIncludes.h is a convenience header that #includes the appropriate OpenGL headers for the target platform.

	* GLSLShader provides simplified vertex and fragment shader setup.

	* GLUtilities provides OpenGL utility functions for translating between string representations and GLenum representations of OpenGL constants.

Does Renderer even do 2D? Maybe just 3D and leave 2D to something else


[17:38]  <ThemsAllTook> Say I'm drawing a room, and a character walking from one side of it to the other. The room is just a static pile of vertices with a material or something; simple enough.
[17:38]  <ThemsAllTook> The character includes some animation data that needs to be passed on to the vertex shader, and some sort of extra animation state information needs to get there too somehow.
[17:38]  <ThemsAllTook> Does the renderer have a concept of animation data? How does it know which shader to use and how to shuffle the data around?
[17:39]  <KatieHuber> just a flag on the model to say "animated" or not
[17:40]  <KatieHuber> (animated models will have different vertex structure from static ones anyway, so always a different shader)
[17:40]  <KatieHuber> the game will submit "draw this object with this model and this state" for every object
[17:40]  <KatieHuber> for static objects, "state" is likely just a xform matrix
[17:40]  <KatieHuber> for animated, the full matrix palette, probably
[17:41]  <ThemsAllTook> OK, great, this is starting to make some sense
[17:41]  <KatieHuber> or it could just be an animation name and time and the renderer could calculate the palette
[17:43]  <ThemsAllTook> I think the trap I keep falling into is imagining that I'm going to want to render an arbitrary number of things in arbitrarily different ways, when I can probably just constrain myself to a few core concepts (static geometry, animated geometry (using just one specific type of animation), particles, etc.) and have my needs covered
[17:44]  <ThemsAllTook> It's just really hard for me to coalesce that list of things in my head. This helps a lot.

Shape keys/morph targets are pretty tricky. Ideas:
- Organize vertices into groups which own morph sets, up to some limit in the vertex shader. Different glDrawElements calls for each group.
* Calculate all morphs in software, and resubmit vertex data every frame for animations that have morphs (only if dirty?).
- Limit entire mesh to some number of morphs, and encode all morph offsets into static vertex data with uniforms for weights.
- Encode vertex data as normal, but calculate offsets for everything at once in software and pass those in some other way. Sampler?
 - This is essentially no better than resubmitting vertex data every frame, since it contains a full list of positions/offsets anyway

Constraints and control objects are Blender-only. Exported animations can be flattened.
