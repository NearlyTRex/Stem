2.0.0 (2017-10-22)
 * Library signficantly repurposed. Rather than a thin layer of glue used by the shell, glgraphics now contains a full OpenGL renderer and associated utilities and data models.

 * Removed library_noglew. Glew is now handled entirely by shell implementations.

 * Adopted GLSLShader, which no longer lives in its own library.
 * Added Color3f
 * New classes added: Renderer, Renderable, MeshRenderable, Material, OrbitCameraController, AnimationState, VertexBuffer. See ReadMe.txt for deatils on each.
