GLGraphics provides some miscellaneous general-purpose OpenGL utility code. Included modules:

 - Camera is a StemObject that models a viewpoint in 3D space.

 - GLIncludes.h is a convenience header that #includes the appropriate OpenGL headers for the target platform.

 - GLInfo provides general information about the OpenGL environment at runtime.

 - GLUtilities provides general-purpose OpenGL utility functions. Currently, the only included functions translate between string representations and GLenum representations of OpenGL constants.
