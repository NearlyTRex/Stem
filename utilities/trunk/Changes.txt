1.7.1
 * Added endian swap functions to IOUtilities

1.7.0
 * Added HashTable (not yet optimized; functional, but likely to be slow and/or memory-inefficient)
 * Added ATOM convenience macro (expands to Atom_fromString)
 * Added 64-bit Windows and Linux support
 * Updated API for shell 1.0.0

1.6.1
 * Atom_fromString now uses a hash table internally and performs significantly faster, with much less penalty for adding more atoms

1.6.0
 * Random.h renamed to Ranrot.h
 * Ranrot can now be instantiated
 * Added stirrand()
 * Updated for stemobject 3.0.0

1.5.0
 * EventDispatcher_unregisterForEvent() now takes a context pointer, which must match the one passed to registerForEvent() to remove the callback. This enables multiple handlers to be registered with the same function pointer and event ID but different context pointers.

1.4.3
 * Fixed a critical bug introduced in 1.4.2 that could cause the wrong event handler to fire after having unregistered for an event from within a callback
 * Backward compatibility for non-Atom event IDs removed.

1.4.2
 * EventDispatcher's eventID strings are now Atoms, and are no longer copied internally. This fixes a potential strcmp of a freed string if an event handler is removed from an event callback, but may cause events to no longer fire if callers are using something other than Atoms or string constants for eventID. Backward compatibility is maintained for non-Atom string constants, but this usage is deprecated and will be removed in the next revision.

1.4.1
 * Atom_fromString will no longer crash when passed NULL, instead returning NULL
 * resourcePath() is no longer necessary and has been removed. Shells now chdir to Shell_resourcePath at startup.
 * memwrite now allows an initial allocatedSize of 0, for callers who wish to use memwriteInit(NULL, 0, 0, true)
 * readFileSimple now writes 0 to outFileLength on read failure
 * utilities no longer depends on shell or stubshell

1.4.0
 * Updated stemobject dependency from 1.1.0 to 2.0.0
 * Synchronized with template_stemlib Stable_2010-11-14
 * Added readStdinSimple
 * Atom and AutoFreePool are now (theoretically) thread safe

1.3.0
 * Updated stemobject dependency from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
 * Updated stubshell dependency from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
 * Refreshed Makefile from template_stemlib Stable_2010-06-02

1.2.0
 * Added temporaryFilePath to IOUtilities
 * Arg 2 of writeFileSimple is now const
 * Refreshed Makefile from template_stemlib Stable_2010-05-22

1.1.0
 * Updated EventDispatcher and FixedIntervalRunLoop to inherit from StemObject
 * Refreshed Makefile from template_stemlib Stable_2010-05-06

1.0.0
 * Added Random
 * Refreshed Makefile and other project files from template_stemlib Stable_2010-03-29
